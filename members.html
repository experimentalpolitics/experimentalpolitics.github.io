            <p> Patrick is an assistant professor in the Department of Political
              Science at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. He received his
              PhD in political science from Stony Brook University.</p>
            <p> His research focuses on the psychological underpinnings of
              political attitudes, reasoning, and behavior. He is especially
              interested in the development and application of new statistical
              methods in the area of political psychology. For example, he has
              used quantitative text analysis to study how citizens discuss and
              justify their political preferences and beliefs in open-ended
              survey responses as well as online discussions. </p>

              University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. </p>
            <p> His political science research spans several substantive areas,

              democratization, the political economy of natural disasters, and
              the politics of race and ethnicity. His diverse research agenda
              employs a variety of data collection and measurement techniques
              and advanced statistical methods which tend to be underutilized in
              quantitative political science. </p>
