                <p>The question of how descriptive representation might affect political behaviour and attitudes is important when considering the role political attitudes play in facilitating a functioning democracy. What role, if any, does co-racial descriptive representation play in the relationship between citizens and local government? What factors underlie attitudes toward local government, generally? Employing a unique set of survey data collected across several dozen cities combined with city-level contextual data, the analysis offers a comprehensive picture of trust toward local governments. Overall, the findings support the hypothesis that descriptive representation has a positive effect on feelings of trust in local government. However, these effects are limited to mayoral representation. Increased levels of descriptive representation in less-visible city councils do not have the same effect.</p>

                <p>There is reason to believe that an increasing proportion of
                  the news consumers receive is not from news producers directly
                  but is recirculated through social network sites and email by
                  ordinary citizens. This may produce some fundamental changes
                  in the information environment, but the data to examine this
                  possibility have thus far been relatively limited. In the
                  current paper, we examine the changing information environment
                  by leveraging a body of data on the frequency of (a) views,
                  and recirculations through (b) Twitter, (c) Facebook, and (d)
                  email of New York Times stories. We expect that the
                  distribution of sentiment (positive-negative) in news stories
                  will shift in a positive direction as we move from (a) to (d),
                  based in large part on the literatures on self-presentation
                  and imagined audiences. Our findings support this expectation
                  and have important implications for the information contexts
                  increasingly shaping public opinion.</p>

                <p>Competitive, vigorous campaigns have been shown to increase
                  participation across a variety of elections, including those
                  at the state and local level. Building on previous work that
                  examines the impact of money in judicial elections, this study
                  explores the impact of campaign effort on participation in
                  state court elections. Using data from 260 state supreme court
                  elections occurring from 1990-2004 across 18 states, I find
                  that competitive campaigns—not just expensive ones—are
                  important for encouraging participation in these contests.
                  Additionally, the study uncovers differential effects of
                  challenger and incumbent spending. Ultimately, the findings
                  contribute to our understanding of campaign effects in
                  judicial elections while also providing an additional test of
                  the idea that campaigns matter, especially in low-information
                  contests.</p>

                <p>We investigate the effect of personality on prosocial
                  behavior in a Bayesian multilevel meta-analysis (MLMA) of 15
                  published, interdisciplinary experimental studies. With data
                  from the 15 studies constituting nearly 2500 individual
                  observations, we find that the Big Five traits of
                  Agreeableness and Openness are significantly and positively
                  associated with prosocial behavior, while none of the other
                  three traits are. These results are robust to a number of
                  different model specifications and operationalizations of
                  prosociality, and they greatly clarify the contradictory
                  findings in the literature on the relationship between
                  personality and prosocial behavior. Though previous research
                  has indicated that incentivized experiments result in reduced
                  prosocial behavior, we find no evidence that monetary
                  incentivization of participants affects prosocial tendencies.
                  By leveraging individual observations from multiple studies
                  and explicitly modeling the multilevel structure of the data,
                  MLMA permits the simultaneous estimation of study- and
                  individual-level effects. The Bayesian approach allows us to
                  estimate study-level effects in an unbiased and efficient
                  manner, even with a relatively small number of studies. We
                  conclude by discussing the limitations of our study and the
                  advantages and disadvantages of the MLMA method.</p>

                <p>This study explores whether and how individuals evoke moral
                  considerations when discussing their political beliefs. By
                  analyzing open-ended responses in the 2012 American National
                  Election Study using a previously validated dictionary, I find
                  systematic ideological differences in moral reasoning, even
                  when respondents are not explicitly asked about morality. The
                  study proceeds to show that the reliance on moral
                  considerations in attitude expression is amplified by the
                  moral content of individual media environments.</p>
